### Components

- **App Component**

  - Manages state (`expenses` array and `filter` string).
  - Renders `ExpenseForm` and `ExpenseList` components.
  - Passes necessary props to child components.

- **ExpenseForm Component**

  - Handles form inputs for adding new expenses (`description` and `amount`).
  - Contains form submission logic.
  - Passes new expense data back to the `App` component through props.

- **ExpenseList Component**

  - Receives `expenses` array as props from `App`.
  - Maps through the array and renders individual `ExpenseItem` components.

- **ExpenseItem Component**
  - Displays details of an individual expense (`description` and `amount`).

## Usage

1. **Adding Expenses**: Use the form to enter a description and amount for a new expense and submit it.
2. **Filtering Expenses**: Enter a keyword in the filter input to display only the expenses that match the keyword.
3. **Sorting Expenses**: Use sorting options to sort the list of expenses by amount or description in ascending or descending order.
